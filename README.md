# qmle
Matlab programs to perform Quasi-maximum likelihood estimation for the linear-in-means peer effects model with group effects. The estimation strategy and the properties of the estimator are discussed in "Kuersteiner, G. M., Prucha, I. R., & Zeng, Y. (2021). Efficient Peer Effects Estimators with Random Group Effects. ArXiv:2105.04330 [Econ, Stat]. http://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04330". 
limpe_re_unc is the main function for the QMLE. lnf_unc,lnf_c,mom34fun,ghfun are four functions used by the main function to calculate the objective function and variance-covariance matrix.
The function works as follows: 
[a,b]=limpe_re_unc(datatable,yvar,groupvar,xivar,xpvar,hetvar,options,x0);
datatable is the data, yvar is the dependent variable, groupvar is the variable for group id, xivar is the list of variables for indiviudal charateristics, i.e., x1 in the paepr.  xpvar is the list of variables whose leave-out-mean are added as indepednet variables, i.e., x2 in the paper. hetvar is the categorical variable that define group types, i.e., $ D_r $ in the paper. options are optimization  options in matlab, which can be left empty, x0 is the starting value of the optimization, which can be left empty.
